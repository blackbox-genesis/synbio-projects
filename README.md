# 🧬 Synthetic Biology Project Portfolio

A curated portfolio of beginner-to-intermediate level dry lab projects in synthetic biology. Each project is coded in Python using Tellurium and Antimony, and simulates gene circuits relevant to iGEM-style work.

## 🔬 Projects

### 1. [Basic Gene Expression](https://github.com/gene-arch/basic-gene-expression)
Simulates fundamental gene expression: DNA → mRNA → Protein, using Tellurium. It models a minimal genetic circuit to understand transcription and translation dynamics.

> **Skills:** Antimony modeling, time-course simulation, matplotlib plotting

---

### 2. [Inducible Gene Expression](https://github.com/gene-arch/inducible-gene-expression)
Models a system where gene expression is controlled by an external inducer. This simulates a toggle-style repression system showing protein output suppression in response to inducer presence.

> **Skills:** Repressor-based circuit modeling, inducible response logic, kinetics simulation

---

### 3. [Inducer Dose Response Simulation](https://github.com/gene-arch/inducer-dose-response-simulation)
Performs a parameter sweep to explore the effect of varying inducer concentrations on protein output. Visualizes how different doses impact gene circuit behavior.

> **Skills:** Parameter sweeping, matplotlib graphing, synthetic dose-response curve generation
